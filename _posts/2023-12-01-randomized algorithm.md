Efficient deterministic algorithms that always yield the correct answer are a special case of efficient randomized algorithms that oly need to yield the correct answer with high probability.  

## Global Minimun Cut
there is a polynomial time algorithm to find a global min-cut in an undirected graph G

### contraction algorithm(Karger)
In the following figure, contracting the edges in the specified order, will find the min-cut. Note that in this
case, we were lucky and did not contract the edges that were in the min-cut

IF we repeat the contraction algorithm $n^2$ln$n$ times,then the probability of failing to find the global min-cut is <1/$n^2$
