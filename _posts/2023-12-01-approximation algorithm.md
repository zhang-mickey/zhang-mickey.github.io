## 
run in polynomial time  
solves arbitrary instances of the problem  
Finds solution that is within ratio p of optimum  

## Load balancing  

### Greedy algorithm is a 2-approximation  

### K Center
There is no polynomial-time solution available for this problem as the problem is a known NP-Hard problem.   
#### Greedy Approximate Algorithm for K Centers Problem
the running time of the Greedy k-center algorithm is O(kn)
