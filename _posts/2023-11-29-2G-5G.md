# Basic model
M/M/1 Queue  
M/M/C Queue Erlang-C model  
M/G/1 PS for single class:  
M/G/1 PS for multi-class: product-form solution  
what product-form means +relation to HSDPA  

## GSM  --(Erlang-B model)


## HSCSD --(multi-rate.knapsack model)

### kaufman-roberts recursion
The KR recursion provides a simple and efficient method for calculating steady-state probabilities without the need for solving complex linear algebraic equations.  
## GPRS --(combined blocking/PS model)

## WLAN 802.11 --(Bianchi model)
The general step:  
A station with a new packet to transmit monitors the channel activity. If the channel is idle for a period of time equal to a distributed interframe space(DIFS),the station transmits.  
At this point, the station generates a `random` backoff interval before transmitting. At each packet transmission,the backoff time is uniformly chosen in the range $(0,w-1)$. The value $w$ is called **contention 
windows**.   
The ACk is immediately transmitted at the end of the packet,after a period of time called short interframe space(SIFS). As the SIFS(plus the propagation delay) is shorter than a DIFS, no other station is able to detect the channel idle for a DIFS until the end of the ACK. 
- contention windows
At the first attempt,$w$ is set equal to value $CW_min$. After each unsuccessful transmission, $ w $ is doubled,up to a maximum value$ CW_{max}=x^m{CW}_min $

### distributed coordination function (DCF)
the fundamental mechanism to access the medium is called distributed coordination function. This is a random access scheme,based on the carrier sense multiple access with collided avoidance(CSMA/CA).

DCF describes two techniques to employ for packet transmission.  

- two-way handshaking

- RTS/CTS
Before transmitting a packet, a station operating in RTS/CTS mode`reserves` the channel by sending a special Request-To-Sent short frame. The destination station acknowledges the receipt of an RTS frame by sending back a Clear-To-Send frame,after which normal packet transmission and ACK response ouucrs.
Since collision may occur only on the RTS frame, and it is detected by the lack of CTS response
`benefit`:Increase the system performance by reducing the duration of a collision when long messages are transmitted. 
### SINR信干燥比
SINR is commonly used in wireless communication as a way to measure the quality of wireless connection

### Multipath fading
On a small time scale,multiple copies of a given signal may strengthen or weaken one another   
These different copies have different path lengths,hence,they arrive with different phases at the receiver.  



 ## UMTS
parallel transmissions

## HSDPA
### channel quality indicator
很多MIMO技术 需要用到信道质量指示器来反馈信道特征给发射器，用以调整发射天线的数据速率，实现自适应调制

 ## Long- Term Evolution
### OFDMA

 ### MIMO
 多径衰落是影响通信质量的主要因素，但MIMO系统能有效利用多径的影响来提高系统容量

### packet scheduling
#### round robin
#### Maximum SNR
always serve flow with best SINR  
#### Proportional Fairness

### 5G
-new communication paradigms
Combining cellular and ad-hoc type of communications(D2D)  
#### 5G beamforming pico cells frequency reuse
Spectrum reuse  
exploit new spectrum  
与之前的蜂窝网络（如3G和4G）相比，频率越高、波长越短、衍射能力越弱，因此在遇到有障碍物的地方，其辐射范围会变得很小  

device to device communications:increase spectrum efficiency.  
#### QoS in communication networks
two approaches:  
##### QoS Control

##### Bandwidth(over)provisioning  
perform regular,coarse traffic measurements  
use rules of thumb  
no QoS control mechanisms  

#### traffic policying

The differences between traffic policing and traffic shaping are as follows:

Traffic policing directly discards the packets whose rate exceeds the rate limit. Traffic shaping, however, buffers the packets whose rate is greater than the traffic shaping rate. When there are sufficient tokens in the token bucket, the device forwards buffered packets at an even rate.
Traffic shaping increases the delay, whereas traffic policing does not.
