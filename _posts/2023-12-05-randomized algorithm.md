Efficient deterministic algorithms that always yield the correct answer are a special case of efficient randomized algorithms that oly need to yield the correct answer with high probability.

#### probabilistic method
use the fact that a random algorithm produces them with probability p>0 to prove the existence of certain solutions.  
## expected approximation ratio


## weighted Max Sat
## 4/3-approximative LP-based algorithm

## Global Minimun Cut
there is a polynomial time algorithm to find a global min-cut in an undirected graph G

### contraction algorithm(Karger)
In the following figure, contracting the edges in the specified order, will find the min-cut. Note that in this
case, we were lucky and did not contract the edges that were in the min-cut

The contraction algorithm returns a min cut with prob >=2/$n^2$  
IF we repeat the contraction algorithm $n^2$ln$n$ times,then the probability of failing to find the global min-cut is <1/$n^2$

### max 3-SAT

Given a 3-SAT formula with k clauses, the expected number of clauses satisfied by a random assignment is 7k/8

### quick sort

we can only guarantee to have the pivot in its correct location because we don’t sort the other elements. Instead, we move them to the left or right of the pivot. Finally, we perform two recursive calls. The first call sorts the elements before the pivot, while the other sorts the ones after.
#### Best-Case Scenario

if we keep dividing the array in half, we’ll end up with the minimum number of recursion levels, which is {O(log(n))}   
Since in each level, we perform O(n) comparisons to put the pivot in its correct location, then the overall complexity in the best-case scenario is O(nlog(n)).  
#### Worst-Case Scenario

the overall time complexity will be{O(n^2)}.

#### randomized QuickSort
O(nlog(n))<=complexity<=O(n^2)} This difference depends on the chosen pivot elements
