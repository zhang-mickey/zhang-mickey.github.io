## Maximal Flow Problem

### max-flow min-cut theorem
the maximum amount of flow passing from the source to the sink is equal to the total weight of the edges in a minimum cut  
This is a special case of the duality theorem for linear programs

### bipartite matching is in P
There are a variety of polynomial-time algorithms for finding an optimal bipartite matching.   
**A common algorithm is one that reduces the matching problem into an equivalent max-flow instance**  



### dominating set
a dominating set for a graph G is a subset D of its vertices, such that any vertex of G is either in D, or has a neighbor in D.
