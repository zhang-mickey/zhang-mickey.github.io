## Maximal Flow Problem

### max-flow min-cut theorem
the maximum amount of flow passing from the source to the sink is equal to the total weight of the edges in a minimum cut  
This is a special case of the duality theorem for linear programs   

### Ford-Fulkerson 


#### 2-SAT
can be solved in polynomial time
