### discrete-time Bernoulli process

### continuous-time Poisson process
the inter-arrival times are independent and exponentially distributed with mean .

### Jackson Network
In queueing networks,the output of one queue may be the input of another.  
In stready-state,the output process if M/M/1,M/M/k queue follows a Poisson process, because no traffic is lost in such queues,the arrival rate must be equal to the departure rate.
