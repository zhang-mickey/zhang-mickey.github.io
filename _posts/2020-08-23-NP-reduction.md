reduction (a technique usually used to show some problem is NP-hard).   
it's useful to know a good number of different NP-complete problems:When you encounter a new problem X and want to try proving it's NP-complete,you want to show Y<=(p)X for some known NP-complete problem Y.  
##### NP-hard
problem P is NP-hard if it can be reduced from all NP problems.   
- Dominating Set: reduction form **Vertex Cover**
Subset sum problem  
Maximum 3-SAT  
- k-center problem: reduction from **dominating set** or **vertex cover**  
Maximum Coverage problem  
##### NP-complete 
#### Big-O
measure the computational efficiency algorithm as **the number of a basic operations it performs as a function of its input length**.  
However, this function is sometimes be overly dependant on the low-level details of
our definition of a basic operation. For example, the addition algorithm will take about three times
more operations if it uses addition of single digit binary (i.e., base 2) numbers as a basic operation,
as opposed to decimal (i.e., base 10) numbers.

#### decision problem
if the output is yes or no
#### optimization problem
if the output is maximum or minimum of the problem instance.  
### P
A problem Q is in
P if given a decision instance (e.g. bound B in K-center problem), we can answer whether there
exists a solution satisfying this instance (e.g. some solution with objective value ≤ B in K-center
problem) in polynomial time of the input size. 
#### NP
if given a decision instance and a solution, we can check whether this solution
satisfies the instance in polynomial time of input size.

### APX
A problem is APX-hard if every problem in APX can be PTAS reduced to it.  
## 
at least as hard as the hardest problems in NP  
a problem H is NP-hard when every problem L in NP can be reduced in polynomial time to H  
### dominating set
Given an undirected graph G = (V, E) and
bound K, we want to decide whether there exists a subset S of V of size K such that every vertex
v ∈ V is either in S or a neighbor of some s ∈ S.

#### reduction 

### Independent Set (packing problem)
pack in as many vertices as possible,subject to conflicts(edges) that try to prevent one from doings this.  
**let G=(V,E) be a graph.Then S is an independent set if and only if its complement V-S is a vertex cover. ** 
- Suppose that S is an independent set. Consider an arbitrary edge e=(u,v). Since S is independent,it cannot be the case that both u and v are in S.so one of them must be in V-S.  It follows that every edge has at least one end in V-S,and so V-S is a vertex cover.
- Conversely,suppose that V-S is a vertex cover. Consider any two nodes u and v in S. If they were joined by edge e,then neither end of e would lie in V-S,contradicting our assumption that V-S is a vertex cover.
#### proof
If we have a black box to solve Vertex Cover,then we can decide whether G has an independent set of size at least K by asking the black box whether G has a vertex cover of size at most n-k.  


### vertex cover(covering problem)
**cover all the edges in the graph using as few vertices as possible.**  
if every edge has at least one end in S  
In a vertex cover, the vertices do the covering,and the edges are the objects being covered.  

### Set cover
Vertex Cover is a covering problem phrased specifically in the language of graphs: set cover is a more general covering problem, in which we seek to over an arbitrary set of objects using a collection of smaller sets.   

### k-center problem
The k-center problem aims to place at most k-centers that service
all clients, trying to minimize the service cost, which is the maximum over all
clients of the minimum work required for the client to be serviced by one of the
centers (this is usually just the minimum distance from a client to one of the
centers.)
#### approximate
this problem cannot be solved within a ρ <=2 approximation factor, unless P = NP .   
use **dominating set**  
### Maximum coverage problem

#### greedy algorithm approximation ratio 1 − 1/e.
